# ExplorePhilippines

My side project, with the aim of helping people discover unique things to do in the Philippines, 
by directing them from one destination to another, and finding the sweet spots in-between.

#### Initial User Stories:
<b>MVP 1</b>
```$xslt
As a user,
When I visit the homepage
I would like to see a map of the Philippines
```
```$xslt
As a user,
When I view the map,
I would like to see some markers with the top destinations
```
<b>MVP 2</b>

```$xslt
As a user,
When I view the map,
I would like to see a form where I can add my own marker to the map
```
```$xslt
As a user,
When I click on a marker,
I would like that destination to be added to the directions form
```
```$xslt
As a user,
When I view the form,
I would like to click 'Get Directions' to see the driving route
```
```$xslt
As a user,
When I refresh the page, 
I would like my directions to persist
```
<b>MVP 3</b>
```$xslt
As a user,
When I view my directions,
I would like an option to see places around my route
```
